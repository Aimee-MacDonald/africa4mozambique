      <p>
        Africa for Mozambique is a task force commissioned by Global Pan
        Africanism Network in collaboration with Association of University
        Students of the University of Eduardo Mondlane (AEU-UEM).
      </p>

      <p>
        The nature of the collaboration sees Africa for Mozambique sourcing and
        forwarding relief aid and expertise from the various regions of the
        globe, where it is operational, and handing over the raised relief aid
        to AEU-UEM., which is on the ground in Mozambique, for delivery and
        implementation in disaster areas. Since the disaster, AEU-UEM has been
        able to deliver 14 tonnes of relief aid.

      <p>
        We encourage all entities which are able, to please forward aid items
        directly to the forwarding address below. If an entitity is unable to
        forward aid directly and needs assistance Africa for Mozambique can
        assist in this regard. With all of the above considered, we prefer that
        donors make cash donations. This is because we prefer to avoid the
        logistical cost of getting the goods to Maputo, where they are shipped
        to disaster areas. Maputo has enough stock for UAE-UEM to purchase the
        aid items within Mozambique and forward to disaster areas.
